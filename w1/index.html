        <p style="border: 2px solid green">Hi I'm Andrew Rockwell, and I'm a <u>League of Legends</u> nerd who 
            also plays <u>tennis</u> and <u>golf</u>. I was always raised playing those
            2 sports, but when around season 4 hit in League, my friend 
            introduced me to the game and I became hooked. I used to 
            try and rank up more in League, but realized around season
            8 that I would rather play for fun than try and be the best.
            So just like tennis and golf, league became a leisure hobby
            that I enjoy a lot on the side instead of trying to become
            the best player around. For tennis and golf I learned around
            my first year of college that I did not want to play these 
            sports competitively. <b>I would rather enjoy a game I love than 
            hate the game down the line.</b>
