                <p><em>Kingsman: The Secret Service</em> is an action packed film that tries to take itself seriously and not seriously at the same time. The film tries to create a balance that shows a serious side when it comes to plot and a fun side when it comes to quick witted jokes and over the top action scenes and music selection. I think the film shows a great balance in this aspect reminding the viewer that this is fiction and should not be taken that seriously while you see extremely violent scenes at times.</p>

                <p>If there is one thing I would compliment over the top, it is how well choreographed the fight scenes are in the movie. There are three major fight scenes and several other fight scenes/conflicts in the film, and all of them are choreographed with such care and meticulous attention to detail with everything going on at once. You see rediculous maneuvers back to back in the action scenes that showcase a bit over the top, which very well balances out the seriousness in the plot by distracting you from how much violence is going on. The church scene is an excellent example of what I mean as you can get distracted very easily as to what is going on.</p>

                <p>Overall I would highly recommend this film to viewers who love action packed films and want to see well constructed fight scenes.</p>
